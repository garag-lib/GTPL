# GTPL - Reactive Template Library with Direct DOM

GTPL is a TypeScript library designed for creating reactive template systems with a unique approach that incorporates Direct DOM and Proxy. Inspired by technologies like Vue.js, angular aot or jsx, GTPL offers an efficient and powerful way to build reactive applications with optimized performance and all of this in a compact 9KB(gzip) javascript package.

## Key Features:

- **Advanced Reactivity:** GTPL makes it easy to create reactive applications using Proxy, enabling more efficient and precise reactivity compared to conventional approaches.

- **Direct DOM:** Unlike libraries that use Virtual DOM, GTPL employs Direct DOM, meaning updates are reflected directly in the DOM without the need for an intermediate abstraction layer. This provides improved performance and more direct interaction with the DOM.

- **Familiar Syntax:** With an intuitive and easy-to-learn syntax, GTPL offers a comfortable and familiar development experience for developers, especially those already familiar with the angular ecosystem.

- **Static Typing:** Written in TypeScript, GTPL leverages static typing to detect errors at compile time and improve code robustness and maintainability.

- **Template Optimization at Build Time:** GTPL enables template compilation in the style of Ahead-of-Time (AOT) of Angular. This means that templates are compiled during the project build phase rather than in the user's browser. This significantly improves performance and reduces browser load, as precompiled templates are ready for immediate rendering.

- **Lightweight Runtime Compiler for Dynamic Templates:** In addition to static template compilation, GTPL also offers a lightweight runtime compiler for working with dynamic templates. This allows for dynamic template generation and manipulation at runtime, providing greater flexibility and customization capabilities in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

## Benefits:

- **Better Performance:** Utilizing Direct DOM and Proxy-based reactivity contributes to optimized performance of applications, especially in scenarios where high rendering speed and DOM manipulation are required.

- **Flexibility:** GTPL offers a high degree of flexibility in component creation and application state management, allowing easy adaptation to a variety of use cases and specific requirements.

- **Scalability:** Thanks to its efficient approach and flexible architecture, GTPL is highly scalable and can be used in projects of any size, from small applications to large enterprise systems.

With GTPL, you can efficiently build reactive applications with superior performance, leveraging the latest innovations in user interface development while maintaining a comfortable and productive development experience for developers. And all of this in a compact 9 KB package!
